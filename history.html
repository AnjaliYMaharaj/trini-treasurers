    <h2> HISTORY OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO </h1>

        <br>

        <ul>

            <li>Trinidad and Tobago’s nearly 1.4 million people are English-speaking, but trace their roots back to Africa and India, China and the Middle East, Europe, and the Mediterranean.</li>
            
            <li>Trinidad and Tobago is the home of Caribbean Carnival. It is also the home of calypso, the music which fuels the Carnival, and the steelband, which evolved in Port of Spain in the 1930s. These are just two of the many musical forms to be found alongside strong traditions of dance, literature, sculpture and painting.</li>
            
            <li>The oldest evidence of human activity on Caribbean soil is in Trinidad: the archaeological site at Banwari Trace has yielded artefacts dating back to 5,000 BC. The first settlers in Trinidad and Tobago are reported to have been two First Peoples (aka Amerindian) tribes as early as 5000BC, often described as the Arawaks and the Caribs, though new research has provided a number of alternative narratives. The influence of the indigenous peoples of these islands is most obvious in place names of Amerindian origin: Arima, Icacos, Mucurapo — to name but a few.</li>
            
            <li>After Columbus landed on Trinidad in 1498, Trinidad remained a neglected outpost of the Spanish empire until the late 18th century; an influx of French Catholic settlers and their African slaves, and the subsequent capture by the British in 1797, changed the island’s destiny. During the 19th century labourers were imported from several parts of the world, notably India. </li>
            
            <li>Tobago was fought over by the Dutch, French, Spanish, and British, as well as settlers from Latvia, buccaneers and others, well into the 18th century, but was controlled primarily by the British from 1762.</li>
