        <p>Located not too far from Venezuela, the dual-island Caribbean nation is filled with seriously gorgeous scenery. Trinidad is home to a combination of more built-up areas, rainforest, beaches, and mangrove swamps and Tobago is everyone’s idea of a laid-back island paradise with glistening beaches, palm trees, and sparkling waters. Both offer excellent diving, waterfalls, bird watching, lively music, and divine cuisine. Here are the best and most beautiful places to visit in Trinidad and Tobago… </p>

                <h2><strong>Manzanilla Beach – an attractive beach on the East Coast of Trinidad</strong></h2>
                <p>What makes Manzanilla Beach one of the best places to visit in Trinidad and Tobago is its unique location, away from the more populated areas. Being so far out of the way, the beach is ideal for those who want a less commercial beach experience and just want a quiet and relaxing one.

                    Manzanilla is also known for being a leatherback sea turtle hatching site. With the built-in boardwalk, you can walk along the shores without getting your feet wet.</p>

                <p>
                    Located on the island of Trinidad, Maracas Bay is one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. The crescent-shaped beach is made up of golden-colored sand that looks striking against the deep blue color of the bay. Along the edges of the beach are lush hillsides.
                    Beach chairs and umbrellas can be rented to help you relax while enjoying the beach. Showers are also available. Maracas Beach is a great place to go if you want to enjoy a local vibe, as various vendors and food trucks offer local snacks and treats. 
                    The locals’ favorite is Richard’s Bake & Shark.

                <img src="trinidad-places/Paria-Waterfall.jpg">
                <p>
                    Visiting the Parai Waterfall should be a part of your two-and-a-half-hour hike to Paria Bay. 
                    The start of the hike is located in Blanchisseuse at the very end of North Coast Road.
                    While the hike to Paria Bay is a tough one, each uphill portion is followed by a nice downhill section. 
                    To see the beautiful Paria Waterfall, you need to head inland once you reach the beach.

                <p> If you are a bird lover or a nature lover, <h2> <strong> the Asa Wright Nature Center </strong> </h2> in Trinidad is a must. This nature center covers 1,500 acres of forest in the Aripo and Arima Valleys. 
                    The area used to be a citrus, cocoa, and coffee plantation, but it is now home to several birds, including the nocturnal oilbird, woodcreepers, pygmy owls, and more.
                    At the Asa Wright Nature Reserve, guests can book a stay in one of the cottages, enjoy the verandah for high tea or lunch, or sign up for a birding tour. 
                    The center uses all money spent by guests at the nature center to purchase additional land, converse the current forest, and fund educational programs.

                <h2> <strong> Port of Spain – the capital city of Trinidad and Tobago </strong> </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Port of Spain is located on Trinidad, which is the southernmost island in the West Indian area. 
                    As the capital city, it is busier than other locations on the island but has a lot to offer. 
                    Port of Spain features three mountain ranges along with numerous beaches that add to the area’s unique landscape.
                    <br>
                    This busy city is known for several tourist attractions, as well as its colonial-style architecture. Many people enjoy visiting Queen’s Park Savannah to see the beautifully built mansions. The Royal Botanic Gardens and the National Museum and Art Gallery are popular destinations. 
                    If you are visiting the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, the Carnival is a must.

                <h2> <strong> Cumana Bay – a tranquil beauty spot </strong></h2>
                <p>
                    If you are looking for places to visit in Trinidad and Tobago that are not overly crowded, check out Cumana Bay. Accessing Cumana Bay is done from Cumana Depot Road, which is located near the Catholic Church in Cumana. Visitors can stay in the village on the beach in beach houses and vacation cottages, or they can try their hand at camping. Supplies can be found in the toco area, and fresh water is available at the Fishing Depot on the northern part of the beach.
                    Kayaking along the Tompire River is a favorite activity for those visiting Cumana Bay. The river mouth is also a well-known nesting site for leatherback sea turtles.

                <h2> <strong> Chacachacare – a mysterious, uninhabited but scenic island </strong></h2>
                <img src="trinidad-places/Chacachacare.jpg">
                <p>
                    Located about five miles off the northwestern coast of Trinidad, you will find Chacachacare Island. With only 900 acres, it is a smaller island, but it’s rich in history.
                    At various times throughout its past, the island was home to whaling stations, cotton plantations, and more. What it is most known for is being the home to a colony of lepers. 
                    Today the island is uninhabited, but visitors come to swim, hike, relax, and even camp.
